# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: [Add your email or contact method here]
2. **GitHub Private Reporting**: If enabled for this repository, please use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab.

We take security seriously and will make every effort to acknowledge your report and address the issue promptly.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the `main` branch is currently supported for security updates.

## Best Practices
- **Never commit your `.env` file**.
- **Always use placeholders** in your public forks.
- **Use n8n Expression Mode** to reference environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets in workflow JSONs.
